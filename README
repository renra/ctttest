== CTT Innovations | Rails ninja test

Dear ninja, 

I would like to introduce you a small challenge you will face:

Your task is to create a simple agile project management tool. Application
should work across major browsers without having significant issues. Once you have 
stable version you are required to deploy it to Heroku (http://www.heroku.com/) Ruby
platform, where you can register yourself and get free account which is enough to 
host the application.

We require you to use Git as version control system, which is fundamental tool for 
our development process. Setup yourself Github account (https://github.com/) if you dont
have one already. After you've done so, you can fork the ctttest repository to your
account and start working on that. Alternatively you can download all the source code
in zip file and unpack. At any case publish your work progress to the github repository.

We would like you to follow this:

* commit often, so your work is split into smaller chunks
* write descriptive comments to your commits so we can understand what are you doing

# Requirements

* System has two major roles "account owner", "developer".

* System should allow user to sign up for the app. Signed up user will automatically became "account owner".
  
* An account will be created after sign up. The account is security scope so all what is defined inside 
  (projects, team member, stories).

* Account owner is able to create, read, update and delete Team members

* Each team member will have its own user in the system, first name, last name, email, password.

* Developer is able to create, read, update and delete project. 

* Each project has its title, description, client, due date and manager.

* Developer can create, read, update and delete story

* Each story has its title, description, estimation on point scale (1,2,3,5,8,20,100), 
  requestor (person who created) and responsible person (requestor or another member of 
  the project team) and state (possible states are listed bellow)

* Each story has life-cycle as waiting / started / finished / delivered / accepted / rejected.

* Developer can change story states like this: 
  waiting > started, 
  started > finished, 
  finished > delivered,  
  delivered > rejected, 
  rejected > started,
  delivered > accepted.
